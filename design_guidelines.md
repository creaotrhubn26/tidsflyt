I need more information before I can create design guidelines for your project.

**Current Status:**
- You have an existing app in GitHub that needs enhancements
- The app hasn't been imported into Replit yet
- No details about the app's purpose, current design, or desired enhancements have been shared

**What I Need to Provide Design Guidelines:**

1. **About your existing app:**
   - What does it do? (e.g., e-commerce, social platform, dashboard, portfolio)
   - What's the current design like?
   - Who are the users?

2. **About the enhancements:**
   - What new features are you adding?
   - What's the scope of redesign? (Minor updates? Complete overhaul?)
   - Are there specific UI/UX problems to solve?
   - Do you want to maintain the current design system or start fresh?

3. **Any specific requirements:**
   - Design preferences or inspirations?
   - Brand guidelines to follow?
   - Target aesthetic (modern, minimal, bold, professional, etc.)?

**Next Steps:**

Please import your repository into Replit, then share:
- A description of what your app does
- What enhancements you want to make
- Any design direction or preferences you have

Once you provide these details, I'll create comprehensive design guidelines tailored specifically to your app and enhancement goals.
